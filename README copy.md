# wtfshouldicook.com

This was created for a capstone project during Thinkful's fullstack course.

I've always enjoyed food and cooking so I figured this would be a fun project. Once upon a time there was a website called wherethefuckshouldieat.com that just pulled random restaurants near you from Google Maps. That inspired me to make this!

A simple website for getting a recipe when you just can't decide!
